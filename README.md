# Service Portal (working title)
Service Portal is an attempt to replicate a barebones ticketing/service management platform using a modern web framework... while also masquerading as a Souls-like blacksmith service fulfillment workspace.

- end-to-end typesafety with React TypeScript + Convex backend
- reactivity applies to all database queries (real-time messaging, task changes, etc.)
- Social SSOs (Discord, Google, TikTok)
- minimal, responsive design

Deployed production link: [service-portal-tau.vercel.app](https://service-portal-tau.vercel.app)
